Should you have a fresh postgres installaton (13 as of today), by default the authentication method
in your pg_hba.conf file will be set to peer meaning it would "require a password" to sign in,
you then have to change that to md5 following the steps below

# Connect to postgresql using the postgres role
sudo -i -u postgres

It will prompt for the password of the current user, You need to provide the password and hit the Enter keyboard.

Then, you can access the PostgreSQL using the psql by typing the following command:

$ psql
You’ll access the postgres prompt like this:

postgres=#
From here, you can interact with the PostgreSQL like issuing a query.

Use the following command to change the password for your current user, which should be postgres:

\password

Enter your new password, and confirm it:

Enter new password:
Enter it again:

Now quit the psql interface:

\q

Step #3: Edit the Authentication Method
For a refresher on editing files with vim see: New User Tutorial: Overview of the Vim Text Editor.
Edit the configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/postgresql/13/main/pg_hba.conf

Find:

local all postgres md5

Then exit and save the file with the command :wq.

Now restart PostgreSQL:
sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service



Step #4: Verify Your Access
Switch back to the postgres user:

sudo -i -u postgres

Enter the PostgreSQL command line:

psql


Enter your password, and you’re in!
